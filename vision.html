          <h2 class="vision-heading">Problems</h2>
          <p class="vision-paragraph">Current blockchain development platforms suffer from a lack of scalability and accessibility. While the slow transaction speeds and high gas fees associated with Ethereum have been addressed with new layer 1 platforms such as Algorand and layer-2 roll ups such as Polygon, blockchain development and usage continues to stagnate when compared to its Web2 counterparts. A majority of the applications that are built on these platforms focus on amassing financial liquidity in the form of on-chain tokens, or driving volume via the selling of some form of digital art. We believe that these applications are not of interest to the average consumer, and the current usage metrics seem to agree with that sentiment.

          <h2 class="vision-heading">Introducing Adamnite</h2>
          <p class="vision-paragraph">We are addressing this issue by creating Adamnite. Adamnite is a new decentralized development platform, allowing for the creation of social media applications, games, and more through a general purpose and decentralized runtime. Through Adamnite’s pythoinic A1 programming language, developers of all backgrounds can create scalable applications, and power those applications through tools like Ceasar, Adamnite’s decentralized messaging SDK. 
        </p>
            <p class = "vision-paragraph">We are also creating Passport, a decentralized social experience that is actually fun but yet retains the core ethos of Web3: decentralization and privacy. Messages are not only end to end encrypted, but are run on a decentralized peer to peer network, guaranteeing censorship resistance. Passport also allows users to transaction on a public blockchain, all without needing to manage private keys or cryptographic signatures. Passport will also allow users to create assets, games, and bets in Adamnite Smart Contracts, through prompts in natural language.

          <h2 class="vision-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          <p class="vision-paragraph">Adamnite will power a new generation of applications built entirely using blockchain technology. While blockchain development platforms have existed for the better part of a decade, significant adoption is still lagging, with security issues significantly degrading the trust of the general public in the space and scalability issues turning off enterprises from building their core infrastructure using blockchain. Adamnite aims to be a permissionless general purpose blockchain that provides developers of all backgrounds the tools they need to build smart contracts that both meet their standards and the standards of their users. We have a strong belief that the blockchain industry is still in its infancy, and as adopters, we are all early in a space that will soon be utilized on a daily basis by millions around the world. By creating a platform that is at once secure, scalable, and efficient, Adamnite will be at the forefront of this future adoption, and will help blockchain technology reach its true potential. </p>
